## 3. Layer Types

| Type | Store Create | Canvas Render | Fabric Object | Properties Panel | Status |
|------|--------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|--------|
| spline | [x] `createSplineLayer()` | [x] `renderSplineLayers()` | [x] SplinePath.ts | [ ] None | **Partial** |
| text | [x] `createTextLayer()` | [x] `renderTextLayers()` | [x] AnimatedText.ts | [x] TextProperties.vue | **Working** |
| particles | [x] `createParticleLayer()` | [x] `renderParticles()` | N/A (Canvas2D) | [x] ParticleProperties.vue | **Working** |
| depthflow | [x] `createDepthflowLayer()` | [?] `syncDepthflowRenderers()` | N/A | [x] DepthflowProperties.vue | **Unclear** |
| shape | [ ] None | [ ] None | [ ] None | [ ] None | **Not Implemented** |

## 4. Tools

| Tool | Button | Keyboard | Store Connected | Canvas Handler | Status |
|------|--------|----------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| Select | [x] WorkspaceLayout | [x] V | [x] **FIXED** | [ ] None | **Partial** |
| Pen | [x] WorkspaceLayout | [x] P | [x] **FIXED** | [x] isPenMode check | **Working** |
| Text | [x] WorkspaceLayout | [x] T | [x] **FIXED** | [ ] None | **Partial** |
| Hand | [x] WorkspaceLayout | [x] H | [x] **FIXED** | [ ] None (alt-drag works) | **Partial** |
| Zoom | [x] WorkspaceLayout | [x] Z | [x] **FIXED** | [ ] None (wheel works) | **Partial** |

### Fixed Issue (2024-12)
WorkspaceLayout.vue now uses a computed property synced to store:
```typescript
const currentTool = computed({
  get: () => store.currentTool,
  set: (tool) => store.setTool(tool)
});
```
Tool state now properly flows to CompositionCanvas via `store.currentTool`.

### Remaining Work
Canvas handlers for select/text/hand/zoom tools still need implementation.

## Critical Fix Priority

### P0 - Blocking Issues
1. [x] **Tools not connected to store** - **FIXED** (2024-12)
2. [ ] **Effects not rendered** - UI-only placeholders
3. [ ] **Audio blocks main thread** - Freezes browser
4. [ ] **No camera layers** - Can't animate cameras

### P1 - Major Issues
5. [ ] updateLayer() has no history
6. [ ] Direct mutations in GraphEditor, ProjectPanel, TextProperties
7. [ ] Timeline markers/solo/work area not persisted
8. [ ] Most layer types not implemented

### P2 - Minor Issues
9. [ ] No delete layer UI
10. [ ] No layer reorder UI
11. [ ] Missing property panels for spline layers
12. [ ] Camera presets not exposed

## ADDENDUM: December 2024 Updates

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-17

### Revised Statistics

| Category | Previous | Current | Change |
|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| Components | 30 | 45 | +15 |
| Services | ~20 | 32 | +12 |
| Tests | ~500 | 851 | +351 |
| Layer Types Implemented | 4 | 10 | +6 |
| TypeScript Errors | Unknown | 0 | Clean |

### Fixed Issues Since Original Audit

1. **[x] Tools connected to store** - WorkspaceLayout.vue computed property
2. **[x] Effects rendered** - effectProcessor.ts + StackBlur algorithm
3. **[x] Audio non-blocking** - Web Worker implementation (audioWorker.ts)
4. **[x] Camera layers** - Full camera system with store integration
5. **[x] Expression system** - expressions.ts service added
6. **[x] Motion blur** - Multi-type motion blur processor
7. **[x] Shape layers** - shapeOperations.ts with boolean ops
8. **[x] services/index.ts exports** - All 32 services properly exported

### New Services Added

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| expressions.ts | Expression evaluation (wiggle, time, etc.) |
| motionBlur.ts | Multi-type motion blur processing |
| shapeOperations.ts | Boolean shape operations |
| propertyDriver.ts | Property linking system |
| frameCache.ts | LRU frame caching |
| audioWorkerClient.ts | Non-blocking audio analysis |

### Remaining P0 Issues

1. **[ ] Particle determinism** - Math.random() still in spawn positions
2. **[ ] Timeline scroll sync** - Sidebar scrolls independently
3. **[ ] Keyframe dragging** - Selection only, no movement

### Updated Layer Type Status

| Type | Previous | Current |
|------|----------|---------|
| camera | Not Implemented | **WORKING** |
| light | Not Implemented | **WORKING** |
| shape | Not Implemented | **WORKING** |
| solid | Not Implemented | **WORKING** |
| null | Not Implemented | **WORKING** |
