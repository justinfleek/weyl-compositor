## Backwards Compatibility Strategy

All breaking property changes use TypeScript type aliases with runtime fallbacks:

```typescript
// types/project.ts - Layer timing
interface Layer {
  startFrame: number;  // New name
  endFrame: number;    // New name
  /** @deprecated Use 'startFrame' instead */
  inPoint?: number;    // Alias for migration
  /** @deprecated Use 'endFrame' instead */
  outPoint?: number;   // Alias for migration
}

// types/project.ts - Video/NestedComp data
interface VideoData {
  speedMapEnabled: boolean;  // New name
  speedMap?: AnimatableProperty<number>;
  /** @deprecated Use 'speedMapEnabled' instead */
  timeRemapEnabled?: boolean;
  /** @deprecated Use 'speedMap' instead */
  timeRemap?: AnimatableProperty<number>;
}
```

Runtime handling pattern used throughout:
```typescript
// Check new property first, fall back to legacy
const speedMapEnabled = data.speedMapEnabled ?? data.timeRemapEnabled ?? false;
const speedMapProp = data.speedMap ?? data.timeRemap;
```

## Legal Disclaimer

This audit is for internal reference only and does not constitute legal advice. Consult with intellectual property counsel before public release.

**Terms of art in motion graphics industry** (keyframe, timeline, layer, etc.) are generally considered generic and not protected. Adobe-specific **UI patterns and feature names** (Pickwhip, Graph Editor, Time Remap, Work Area) have been renamed to generic alternatives.
